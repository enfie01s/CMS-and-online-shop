<span class='heading'>4 ways to avoid Malcom</span><br /><br />Malcolm Grendon is the manager of GMK's workshop and during the year he handles hundreds of rifles and shotguns sent for repair or service. According to Malcolm, although some of the work arises from accidents and mishaps, most of it would be avoidable if owners took a few precautions in the form of simple maintenance and care. So if you want to keep clear of a potentially expensive introduction to Malcolm and his team take heed:</div><br /><br />
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong><u>Keep your knuckles in fighting order</u></strong> The knuckle is the name of the hinge where the barrels open. A simple, light, application of oil each time the gun is used will prevent the scoring that will otherwise occur, eventually leading to real difficulty getting the gun to open or close.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong><u>Guns are not waterproof...</u></strong> Time and again owners will, after a day's shooting or at the end of the season, put their guns away wet and time again they will experience problems with rust. Drying the gun and from time to time applying a little gun oil will stop any possibility of rust damage.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong><u>...and neither is wood</u></strong> Constant exposure to wet conditions will cause the stock to expand or heave causing splitting. All that's needed is to dry off the weapon fully and every so often apply a little conditioning oil (available from all retailers) to the stock</li>

<li><strong><u>Don't get choked up</u></strong> Keeping your multi-chokes clean is essential. Frequently these are left on the gun dirty. Eventually they become corroded in place with expensive results. They should be cleaned and slightly loosened when the gun is put away - but don't forget to tighten them up before use. The rules apply if your rifle is fitted with a sound moderator. </li>
</ol>
