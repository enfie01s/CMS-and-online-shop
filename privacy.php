<strong>This site uses cookies to remember your login details and also uses third-party (google) cookies for analytics.</strong>

Cookies are small files sent from the website to your browser, the information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

The former are deleted as soon as you close your browser and the latter will stay until the cookie's expiration (which varies from site to site). Cookies are used to enhance your experience by remembering you as a logged in user, remembering site preferences and tailoring the site to your needs. They are also used to collect and store data for analytics and demographics.
